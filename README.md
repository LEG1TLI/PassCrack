Hi! welcome to PassCrack. This tool is meant to be a password bruteforce tool using C++. I have no doubt there are many just like it, but this one is mine! This is v1.0.0, but this project will be consistently updated as I find time!

Features:
-4, 6, and 8 digit password bruteforcing (randomly generates numbers until a match is found)
-dictionary attack using a custom wordlist 

Coming features:
-ability to use output to attempt bruteforce on devices via USB port 
-use of custom wordlists (seclists, etc.)
-plain old password generator 

HOW TO USE:
lowkey pretty straightforward. I'm including the compiled binary, but you can also use g++ to directly compile the source code yourself. I'll keep providing updates and eventually make this a much better and functioning app, but for now I just want to put this out there.
but if you wanna compile it you'd do something like g++ passcrack.cpp -o passcrack.exe and there you have it.
